        <p>Academic project, done for CS373 Software Engineering.</p>

      <h4>what was done</h4>
        <p>A team of 5 created a robust database website hosted on Rackspace, content centered on Game of Thrones.</p>

      <h4>when was it done</h4>
        <p>June-July 2015</p>

      <h4>where was it done</h4>
        <p>University of Texas at Austin</p>

      <h4>why was it done</h4>
        <p>To create a simple, clean and easy to use database website.</p>

      <h4>how was it done</h4>
        <p>We used a variety of tools including Django, MySQL and Bootstrap.</p>

      <h4>description</h4>
        <p>
          My team and I built GoTDB over the course of three weeks. Before we began this project, none of us had any experience with web development. We worked for several hours each day, most of which were spent learning the tools. I eventually found my place in the back-end development; I worked with Django and created models to represent our content. I used MySQL to manage the database. Because we were on such a budget for time, there are a few details we had to overlook, including some front-end cosmetic issues. Overall, we're very happy with the result, especially considering we had no web development experience before this project.
