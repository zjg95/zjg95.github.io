      <h4>For whom was it done</h4>
        <p>Non Academic project, done for self-enrichment.</p>

      <h4>what was done</h4>
        <p>I created a simple 2D game in java modeled after the existing game Pokemon Puzzle League.</p>

      <h4>when was it done</h4>
        <p>November - December 2013</p>

      <h4>where was it done</h4>
        <p>Austin, TX</p>

      <h4>why was it done</h4>
        <p>To learn more about programming techniques and become familiar with Java's GUI libraries.</p>

      <h4>how was it done</h4>
        <p>I used Java, and its Swing and graphics libraries.</p>

      <h4>description</h4>
        <p>
          PuzzlePals is a simple 2D puzzle video game that I created after completing my first
          programming course in Java. I modeled the game after an existing puzzle game style.
          The game supports two players whose actions actively affect each other’s play
          environment. I spent just about all my free time during the fall and spring semesters
          working on this project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I was a novice at the time, I encountered many challenges during this project
          that I didn’t understand, such as synchronization with multiple threads of execution.
          Though I later learned how to implement these solutions in my upper division
          coursework, I did not return to PuzzlePals to update the code.
