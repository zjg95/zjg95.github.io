title: Phase Two
---

This whole week has been a total blur. I feel like I've spent my entire extistence working on projects. I definitely underestimated Integer. I thought it would be a simple little class that wouldn't take much longer than 10 hours. Boy was I wrong. I spent nearly 30 hours tweaking it, trying to get it just right. It's left me very little time to focus on the website.

For people who had no idea how to do any kind of web development until a little over a week ago, I'm honestly pretty impressed with what we've managed to produce so far. Our rackspace server is still hosting Phase 1's work, and I find it interesting to look back and see how far we've come in just a little more than a week's worth of work.

Our website is starting to look beautiful. Data scraping is coming along quite well; we've gotten to the point of finally being able to insert our harvested data into our database! The pages are looking sophisticated and clean, and the user interactions are smooth.

Just about everyone has found their place in the work. Michael has handled data scraping, and Matt has pretty much taken over the entire front-end development. Scott and Lucas have been working with the API, and I've handled the back-end database. I've never had any experience with MySQL before, so it's been somewhat challenging for me. However, with the power of google by my side, nothing is impossible!

With just a few days left of Phase 2, we've all been working hard to get as much done as we can. I have to admit that when Downing first assigned this project I was fearing for my life. But now, I feel like it's smooth sailing from here on out.
