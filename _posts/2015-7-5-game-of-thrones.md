title: Game of Thrones

I feel like I have undergone a great journey this week. We had our first exam on Monday, which was an adventure in itself. It actually came up on me by surprise; I didn't realize it was coming until Downing mentioned it in class a few days before. With the exam looming ahead, and two more projects assigned, it was a very bad weekend to start catching up on the recent season of Game of Thrones.

Although I tried to pace myself, I found myself marathoning the entire 5th season in less than a few days. The emotions were very real. I felt like a shell of my former self, drifting meaninglessly across the campus. I still don't know why HBO doesn't have a premium package that includes counseling when you watch Game of Thrones.

Feeling very inspired by the story, I decided to check out the first book from the library. I haven't been much of a reader since middle school, but when the story is good enough I can become captivated by the pages. Although getting time to read the book would be a very different story of its own.

#### The Project

When Downing gave us the opportunity in class to talk to each other and form groups, everyone seemed to find their partners rather quickly. I was no exception. The five of us had never met before, but we were all in both of Downing's classes, and were ready to work. The task was first to pick a subject on which to focus our website, and I only had one thing on my mind that whole week: Game of Thrones. The group adopted the subject with open arms. All but one of us had seen the show, and those who had were major fans.

We began the project shorly after, knowing that a long road was ahead of us, since nobody had any experience with the tools that Downing wanted us to use. In other words, nobody had a clue how to approach this problem. After hours of discussion and frustration, we had some ideas to work with. By the end of day 2 we had some basic models in our database, and I began construction of the splash page. After another collaboration session, we built a basic yet pretty user interface. 

#### The Road Ahead

At this point, everything is starting to come together, which is extremely comforting. I can remember the fear I felt in the beginning when none of us knew how to tackle the beast. Now I feel like the rest is downhill from here. I'm looking forward to producing a meaningful website, and I hope it is found worthy of the fantastic story that its content is based on.
