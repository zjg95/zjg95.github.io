title: A Decade Later
---

When I was around 12 years old I remember fiddling with my home network's router in such a way that managed to allow incoming connections to my computer. I had no idea what I was doing, so I probably opened my network to hacker exploitation, but in the end I was able to set up a simple HTML web page that anyone who knew my ip address (and probably anyone else) could access.

To test it out, I had some friends access the page, and try to download some music files from my computer. Sure it worked, but the connection was uncomfortably slow. That was when I learned that your network's upload speed mattered, and that mine was uploading at 50kb/s, a snail's speed compared to today's modern speeds. Since even AOL's instant messager had better file transfer, and I didn't want to learn HTML, I shut down my web page and it was eventually lost when my computer's hard drive failed a few years later.

### This Week

On Wednesday of this week in Downing's class we had a guest lecturer from Rackspace. He spent some time talking to us about careers in computer science, but he spent the better part of the lecture discussing what it takes to get a server up and running on Rackspace. This will prove useful to us since we will be required to build a website and host it through Rackspace pretty soon in this class.

I was completely unfamiliar with their services, so I was very intruiged. I was actually surprised by how easy it was to get everything up and running. The part that I found to be the most interesting though was that the server is a completely functional machine that is remotely accessible through SSH.

### The Weeks to Come

The more I thought about it, the more I began to remember my little web page from 10 years ago. When I initially signed up for this class, I had no idea what to expect, and didn't even know that we'd be building a website. Now that I'm aware of our future requirements, I'm really excited for the opportunity to fulfill what I set out to do a decade ago, but on a much grander scale. 

I'm also very interested to see how I'll fare with front-end development. Up until now in my CS career at UT I have exclusively worked with back-end development. It actually seems a little strange to me that a graduating senior could go four years without ever studying graphical user interfaces. Better late than never, I suppose!
