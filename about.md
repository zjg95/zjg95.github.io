My name is Zachary Goodman. I am a student graduating in December 2015 from the University of Texas at Austin with a BS in Computer science and a [certificate in information security](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/academics/certificate-programs/infosec). I’m a big fan of C++ but I’m interested in all aspects of programming; I love to create and write software, regardless of the language or platform. I have an affinity for collaborative design, and I work strongly as an individual as well.

Seeing the product of my code is the most rewarding feeling to me. There’s nothing better than working my way through a complex problem and finally figuring out the secret “missing piece” to the puzzle. I love challenging my programming skills with coding problems. I don’t always know the answer, but what fun would it be if I didn’t learn something new from it?

I’ve learned a lot in these past few years at UT. My Computer Science classes have laid a strong foundation of problem solving knowledge, and I’ve learned how to use my resources to find the answers to the problems I don’t know how to solve. If a program misbehaves I probably can’t tell you right away what the exact cause is, but I have enough troubleshooting and debugging experience to work my way to the source (I once drove myself crazy trying to determine why my output wasn’t right, only to find that I hadn’t actually flushed the output buffer).

When I am given the freedom to create and build, I thrive. I have a strong passion for programming; I obsess over coding projects even during my time off. I believe that I will be a strong addition to any team, both productively and socially.
