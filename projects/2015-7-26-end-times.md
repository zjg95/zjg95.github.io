It's hard to believe the summer is already just about over. This was the very first summer that I've ever been away from home, and my first summer ever taking classes. I've always said I would never do summer school; I've never wanted to and I've always had family commitments to attend to. But since my fall graduation would be delayed an extra semester if I didn't, there wasn't much choice involved. 

### My background

I've taken one class with Downing before and I barely made it through with a passing grade. As such, I was determined to do better this time. For the first time in my college career, I cut my hours at work. I went from the usual 25-35 hours a week down to 16. My wallet has been hurting really badly all summer. Fortunately I haven't had much time to notice since I've spent most of my time in the GDC labs working on assignments.

When I first entered Downing's Software Engineering class I had no experience with Python, or any of the web development tools that we were required to use for our websites. I had better luck with Generic Programming; I had experience with C++ from a previous class, so I was feeling pretty confident.

### And so it begins...

The first three weeks were a breeze; I spent hardly any time on the assignments before completing them, and I was feeling good. But once project 3 came around (IDB1) everything shifted in an entirely new direction. I spent nearly all hours of the day working on projects. My girlfriend started to wonder where I was since she seldom saw me.

I was honestly pretty scared when the website was first assigned. I thought about dropping the class and taking the easy way out; I could register for Contempory Issues in the fall and get my writing flag. I met my group, and the feeling was pretty mututal. None of us knew anything, but together we felt like we had a chance. We were all enrolled in both classes, so we all had the same fears and pains, as well as availability. It seemed like it would work out. 

The first few days were rough and stressful, but once we got a rough prototype of our website running, it was all downhill from there. We felt equipped and ready to take on anything Downing could throw at us.

### Be careful what you ask for!

About a week later the next C++ assignment was posted and we were ready to cry; our assignment was to implement our own version of the C++ STL Deque class. Without getting into too much detail, Deque was a monster in disguise; we all estimated it would only take ~15 hours, but in actuality we spent more than 30 hours fighting that beast.

There came a point where the stress was so heavy that I considered dropping Generic Programming. I was busy at all hours with the website, and wasn't even close to finishing Deque. With only a couple days before the deadlines, the pressure was real. Fortunately I had a fantastic partner who was a tramendous help. Together, we were able to finish Deque and the website.

### Now that it's over...

These last few weeks have been a real ride. It's good to finally be done. I've learned a lot, and I'm proud to have made it through. Overall, this summer has been a challenging but rewarding experience, and to be honest there's a part of me that's sad that it's over.

### Thank you, Downing

Ultimately I will definitely miss Downing. I have learned so much from his classes, and he has undoubtably added numerous skills to my knowledge bucket. I think he is one of the finest instructors at this university, and it's a shame that there are not more people like him teaching us. Thank you, Downing, for your time, patience, and expertise.
